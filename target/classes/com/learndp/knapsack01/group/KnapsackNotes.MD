**__Types of KnapSack Problems__**
a) Knapscak01 :  Here all the weights are can be used only once. 
b) Unbounded-Knapsack: 

**Problem Statement**
One is give list of weights and there individual values which is to be used to choose to fill knapscak
  Important Points: 
 	1) Knapsack01- Only one unit of weight is available. 
 	2) Weights are not present in sorted order.
 	3) The goal of the problem is to get the maximum value with least knapsack space wasteage. (i.e. knapsack can be partially filled )  
 

**Solution**
Recursive : Knapsack01.java
Recursive /Memonization/Bottom-UP Approach: 
	Variables which are changing only those matrix will be created.
	As we need the values till n and w , size of matrix is n+1, w+1
	
Iterative /Tabular Approach/Top-Down Approach :

** Knapsack01 Problem Variations**
===================================
a) Subset Sum Problem
b) Equal Sum Partition
c) count of Subset Sum
d) Minimum subset sum difference
e) Target Sum 
f) No of subset given difference
g) rod cutting problem. **
  
**Unbounded Knapsack Problem Variations**
==========================================
a) Rod Splitting
b) coin chaning problem : Mimimum number of coins
c) Coin changing : Maximum number of coins
d) Maximum ribbion cut.
